## Supplementary material TODOs


 * Website:
    * Make the README generation dynamic
        * Add support for substitutions
    * Shuffle Candidate and trianing images.

* Supplementary material stuff:
    * Did you include complete proofs of all theoretical results? [Yes] provided in the supplementary material
    * Did you include the code, data, and instructions needed to reproduce the main experi512 mental result (either in the supplemental material or as a URL)? [Yes]
    * Did you specify all the training details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen)? [Yes] provided in the supplementary material
    * Did you include the total amount of compute and the type of resources used (e.g., type of GPUs, internal cluster, or cloud provider)? [Yes] provided in the supplementary material
        AWS p2.xlarge
    * Did you mention the license of the assets? [Yes] in the supplementary material
    * Did you include any new assets either in the supplemental material or as a URL? [Yes]
    * Did you discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose data you’re using/curating? [Yes] provided in the supplementary material
    * Did you discuss whether the data you are using/curating contains personally identifiable information or offensive content? [Yes] provided supplementary material
    *  Detailed results are available on the website provided in the supplementary material.
    *  We provide a browsable interface for the dataset at an anonymized website given at the beginning of the supplementary material.
    * We provide the proof in the appendix. We propose the use of FO-SL to learn discriminators.
    * Our engine also allows the generation of multiple solutions till the space of solutions is exhausted. See Appendixfor details.
    * Finally, the position of each object in each image configuration was jittered randomly before finally rendering the image. See Appendix for details of the dataset and generation of different classes of variants.
    * We then choose the answer as the candidate image that is most similar to all the example images (i.e., one for which the product of similarity measure with all example images is maximised) — see Appendix for details.
